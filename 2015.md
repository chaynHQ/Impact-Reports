2015 was our best year yet and we’re thrilled to present this impact report to you on International Women’s Day! 
 

## 2014 IN REVIEW

2014 was a year in which we grew and learned. It began with trying to identify the needs of women in abusive relationships, find ways to increase our impact, and create ongoing momentum by bringing our volunteers together to found a sustainable future. It ended with six new tools in our Chayn toolkit, including three o2-funded guides on [mental health](http://chayn.co/mental-health/), [building your own domestic violence case without a lawyer](http://chayn.co/how-to-build-your-own-case/) and protecting your privacy online; £1300 raised through our Empowerment Fund, which we used to help vulnerable women; tens of volunteers, old and new, meeting online and in person for Chayn Day every first Sunday of the month; and the appointment of an Executive Team, which rotates every three months, to give our work more focus and impetus. We also organised our first hackathon – [EndSVCHack](http://endsvchack.com/), which brought 100 people together to address violence against women and was supported by the UK Foreign Office, Embassy of the Netherlands, Embassy of Sweden, and MakeSense. We entered 2015 with three big projects in mind: a guide on [How to Build Your Own Domestic Violence Case Without a Lawyer](http://chayn.co/how-to-build-your-own-case/), our “Soul Medicine” project, and an Escape Guide.

## HOW DID WE CHANGE IN 2015?

Building on our experiences from 2014, in 2015 we continued to work on our organisational structure, to make Chayn’s impact even greater and more sustainable. As we’ve grown our projects, we’ve been experiencing a huge influx of interest from volunteers. With more resources at our disposal, we have focused on increasing our productivity in 2015.


- **We learned to prioritise**: out of the three projects we “entered” 2015 with, we dropped one and decided to focus on two – a set of anti-stalking guides, and the legal toolkit on [How to Build Your Own Domestic Violence Case Without a Lawyer](http://chayn.co/how-to-build-your-own-case/), which has been a **great landmark **of this year. We also, painfully, decided to stop our direct assistance program for women in Pakistan, because our limited resources made it difficult to ensure the high level of security and management that such an undertaking requires.

 

- ******We kept working on our organisational structure and ways of running a complex volunteer-based organisation. **We adopted a mini-task and sprints-driven approach to workflow to fit around the schedules of a diverse and global team, and started a rotation of one-month project leads. In fact, we had such a good year in terms of creating process and work streams, that due to popular demand, we [wrote a widely shared blog post detailing it for others](https://medium.com/@hera/running-a-fluid-and-democratic-volunteer-run-organisation-3538e12c699e)!****

 

- **We also embarked on several new projects,**: [PeaceHackBEY](http://chayn.co/peacehackbey/), a hackathon for women, youth and refugees in Lebanon; the [EmpowerHack](http://empowerhack.io/) in London, addressing the needs of refugee women and girls; and [Chayn Italia,](http://chayn.co/tag/italia/) another web platform for women suffering abuse in Italy. This expands our reach to yet another country. We received funding from UnLtd to start Ammal (a pay-it-forward learning network for women), which we are launching in 2016. More on this in next year’s report!  These projects have increased our reach and range of expertise. We’re looking at accessibility and inclusivity, especially in the context of non-hetero relationships, and considering how we use technology  for project management, particularly as the majority of our Italian volunteers organise their activism through methods that don’t include social media or Slack.

 

- The year we learnt adopted a **multi-media rich approach**. From [GIFs ](http://makeagif.com/HKT08h)for [How To Build Your Own Domestic Violence](http://chayn.co/how-to-build-your-own-case/) to catchy graphics, [podcasts](https://soundcloud.com/chayn-hq) and [op-eds](http://chayn.co/about/press/) – we’re leveraging all channels to reach vulnerable women!

 

- Learnt how to **leverage networks of professionals** who want to give back – be it as user experience designers, illustrators, developers or policy experts! This year, more than ever, we’ve enlisted the help of external groups to help us build stronger and more user-friendly resources rather than just doing it all in-house.

 

# HIGHLIGHTS OF 2015

This year, we have been shaping our vision and direction: we began to learn what we are really good at and how to capitalise on it. Some of the things that particularly stood out were:

## THE HACKATHONS

Following the success of the [EndSVHack](http://www.urlarena.com/www.endsvchack.com), one of the winning teams – PromiseApps – approached us to organise a hackathon addressing the problems faced by women refugees in Lebanon. Over the course of preparations, we have partnered with **International Alert**, as well as several other organisations in UK and Beirut, and – responding to the voices of the Lebanese society – expanded our focus to the needs of **women, youth and refugees in Lebanon.**

 

That is how [**PeaceHackBEY **](http://chayn.co/peacehackbey/)came about. It attracted nearly **50 participants**, who generated **167 ideas **and formed **nine teams, which developed nine digital tools. **Despite initial challenges (such as no volunteers or contacts in Lebanon, and little knowledge about the region), Chayn volunteers rose to the challenge, produced detailed research to understand issues faced by women, youth and refugees in Lebanon and used social media and word of mouth to expand our network and spread the word about the hack. The teams from the hackathon have been busy since then!  Congrats to [Reable ](http://www.reable.tech/)for being the winner for the I[dea Stage Startup Competition at the BDL](http://www.reable.tech/reable-outpitches-internationals-at-bdl-accelerate/) Accelerate hackathon. Also, we are so proud of Step Forward for their participating on entrepreneurship summit. [Natkalam ](http://natakallam.com/)for partnership with SAWA and for being on [NBC news](http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/syrias-suffering-families/syrian-tutors-explore-space-between-worlds-words-n454801)!

 

Overall, [PeaceHackBEY ](http://chayn.co/peacehackbey/)was a great success, featured prominently in the social media, as well as in local TV, through two TV interviews. It has also been a great learning experience for [Chayn](http://chayn.co/), and it allowed us to expand, and refine, our knowledge on how to make impactful hackathons. Out of the seven hackathons International Alert was running around the world – [PeaceHackBEY ](http://chayn.co/peacehackbey/)was considered one of the best in terms of the quality of results!

 

PeaceHackBEY also helped establish [Chayn’s ](http://chayn.co/)stronghold in the Middle East. Views to our resources from Lebanon and Jordan have increased dramatically and more people from these countries are requesting to volunteer! While the response from [PeaceHackBEY](http://chayn.co/peacehackbey/) was encouraging beyond our expectations, and the quality of teams blew us away, engaging with the teams online to support their progress has been problematic. Since we did not have a big volunteer team in Lebanon, we had to communicate almost exclusively online. This posed a cultural challenge, since online and remote work did not match well with the local working culture in Lebanon, where face-to-face interaction is preferred.

 

In October, we were approached by Han and Kimi who, hot off the heels of a [**Techfugees** ](http://techfugees.com/)hack, wanted to take their prototype and idea further by focusing on solutions for challenges faced by women and girl refugees. After a brainstorming session we came up with [**EmpowerHack **](http://empowerhack.io/)– an open tech-based initiative to tackle specific challenges faced by female refugees in conflict zones, refugee camps, and settled areas and empower them by placing technology into their hands.

 

A hackathon was held on 28-29 November 2015 where teams of designers, coders, and humanitarian workers worked together to create tools that addressed urgent and specific problems and limitations faced by women in and out of refugee camps.

 

Our objectives were divided into three broad challenges: Health, gender-based violence prevention, and employment and education. The hackathon saw more than 100 applicants, whittled down to 50 attendees, which turned into nine hack teams creating solutions within the three categories. Partners included: [Techfugees](http://techfugees.com/), Newspeak House, [StartUp Boat](https://www.hawk-e.com/), [Open Lab](http://www.open-lab.com/) at Newcastle University, Woo Commerce, Cybersalon, Ada’s List, Bristlr, Toptal

 

[**EmpowerHack **](http://empowerhack.io/)didn’t stop after the teams had presented their minimum viable products or when the hackathon ended. We created an internal volunteer-run initiative, which took the two teams  that showed the greatest promise and clearest route to market (through partnership with a field NGO) and have made them happen. You can see the progress of [HaBaby](http://hababy.empowerhack.io/index.html) here, and [HerStory](https://www.tackk.com/HerStory) here.

 

What started as a partnership between [Techfugees ](http://techfugees.com/)and [Chayn](http://chayn.co/), has now spun off as a community of its own with 169 contributors. It’s a community we’re committed to supporting and our volunteers are heavily involved in establishing [**EmpowerHack** ](http://empowerhack.io/)as an ongoing event, bringing technology, design, and NGOs together to address challenges that affect women and girls around the world. We’re organising [**EmpowerHackHEALTH**](http://crises.lshtm.ac.uk/?p=2319), a global refugee health hackathon to take place on 8 April 2016.  

 

Overall, 2015 was the year when we have **started to become really good at organising hackathons, and making them impactful**. This is definitely a skill we will be bringing into 2016, to capitalise on our experiences and lessons learned.

## THE ONLINE GUIDES

One of our big successes this year was the launch of “[How to Build Your Own Domestic Violence Case Without A Lawyer](http://chayn.co/how-to-build-your-own-case/)”. The guide was inspired by experiences of survivors, who struggled to navigate the legal maze and claim their rights, because they could not afford a lawyer, or had poor legal representation.

 

We built the guide through a collaborative process, with domestic violence survivors, lawyers, psychologists and social workers, and we also consulted domestic violence online support groups and multiple NGOs and charities to gather feedback on the guide. This led to a creation of a legal toolkit providing easy-to-follow, step-by-step advice on how to collect and present evidence on domestic violence – whether it is for a civil or criminal court case, or to support an asylum claim. We published the guide online, available in several formats, as well as in an audio form to facilitate access to it.

 

The guide hit the bullseye with domestic violence victims and we received a lot of positive feedback. One of the survivors said: “I wish I had read it 10 years ago. It has better advice in it than I have been ever given by any solicitor or the police about collecting evidence. I could have had TONS of evidence.” In the context of the UK, the guide came at a time when it was much needed, given the legal aid cuts, which restricted access to legal representation. As a result, our [London launch](http://chayn.co/2015/11/16/could-a-free-toolkit-help-lawyers-charities-solve-uks-domestic-violence-crisis/), organised in November 2015 together with the [Garden Court Chambers](http://www.chambersandpartners.com/uk-bar/firm/10406/garden-court-chambers/logo), attracted over 30 participants from law-firms and NGOs working with domestic violence survivors.

 

We replicated the participatory, survivor-led guide development process in other projects. This year  saw ongoing work on the “How Someone can Stalk You & What You Can Do About It” guide. We decided to split the guide into two parts – one focusing on online and the other on offline stalking – to make sure we provide easy-to-follow but detailed information on ways to assess the risk of stalking in online and physical spaces, and how to protect yourself against  them. The guides will be launched in early 2016.

 

Our work in 2015 has allowed us to developed a “recipe” to make **online guides** in a way that makes them into an **open, collaborative, empowering enterprise**. Not only the final product, but also the **process** **is 100% geared towards survivors**. Solutions are created for survivors, by survivors. By developing a strong network of committed volunteers that drop in and out for cycles, most of whom have had some experience of abuse in their life, – we’ve created a community that learns from each other and builds upen existing knowledge. Also one that has do much love and fun – that many volunteers have become close friends. We’re very proud of our internal culture and hope to make it even stronger in the new communities we touch!

 

# REACH

2015 is the year we started, proactively getting involved with the wider NGO, activist and tech community by going to events, hosting workshops and engaging with the media. We felt we had worked very hard up till 2014 in doing our first projects that now we could engage with the wider community. Here are just a few:

    - [Hera ](https://twitter.com/herahussain)got the chance to meet the most awesome online feminist activists from around the world working on online harassment at Harvard’s Berkman Centre! She also gave a talk at [Emerge ](http://emergeconference.co.uk/?portfolio=hera-hussain)(run by Said Business School at University of Oxford) and Durham University amongst many other small events.

 

    - [Hera ](https://twitter.com/herahussain)and [Dina ](https://twitter.com/dariss87)hosted a session at [Mozfest](https://2015.mozillafestival.org/)!

 

    - [Dina ](https://twitter.com/dariss87)and [Wisam](https://twitter.com/wisamafisa), spoke at and helped host a workshop at University of Westminster on the refugee crisis.
 

- [Mahnoor ](https://twitter.com/xmxahnxxrx)spoke at the [Seeds of Peace Conference](http://www.seedsofpeace.org/) in NYU Abu Dhabi.

 

Our website Chayn.co had a 100% increase in views since 2014. Using website analytics, we realised that there were regions where Chayn was having influence – unplanned influence. Hence, we started translated our guides and toolkits, and made our projects more oriented towards the international community.

 

#### ACROSS ALL CHAYN PLATFORMS, WE REACHED 60 000 PEOPLE, WITH OVER 205 876 PAGE VIEWS OF OUR RESOURCES IN OVER A DOZEN COUNTRIES. THESE ARE JUST THE NUMBERS WE CAN TRACK ONLINE – WE KNOW MANY OF OUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND ARE USING OUR RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THOUSANDS OF WOMEN.

#### 

 

Top interaction for Chayn.co – the house for our guides, came from UK, USA (with increasing traffics from Lebanon, Italy, China and Brazil) and the top 3 pages were [How To Build Your Own Domestic Violence Case Without A Lawyer guide](http://chayn.co/how-to-build-your-own-case/), [About Chayn](http://chayn.co/about/), and [Projects](http://chayn.co/projects/). For [Chaynpakistan.org](http://chaynpakistan.org/) the majority views coming from Pakistan, and with USA coming in second with 22.7% of the total views. The 3 most popular pages – [Housing](http://chaynpakistan.org/housing/), [Law – Divorce](http://chaynpakistan.org/law-divorce/), and [Am I Being Forced To Marry](http://chaynpakistan.org/am-i-being-abused/am-i-being-forced-to-marry/) – give us an insight into what resources are sorely needed (and are sorely lacking) for Pakistani women. This discovery further sets our resolve to seek solutions within Pakistan for safe housing for women, as well as legal aid and keeping young girls safe from forced marriage.

 

Having only launched in March 2015, [Chaynindia.com](http://chaynindia.com/)surpassed expectations with 67,977 total page views. Unsurprisingly, most views did come from Indian visitors, but yet again visitors from the United States made the second highest number of views, giving us reason to believe that a [Chayn ](http://chayn.co/)web platform would be an incredibly useful and vital resource for American-based survivors of domestic violence. The 3 most popular pages: [Law & Divorce](http://chaynindia.com/law-divorce/), [Chayn India Home Page](http://chaynindia.com/), [Am I Being Forced To Marry](http://chaynindia.com/am-i-being-forced-to-marry/). Indian women are most concerned about getting out of an abusive marriage, and youths are concerned about being forced into marriage by their parents – demonstrating the stark similarity between social problems faced by both Pakistani and Indian women in 2015.

 

One promising insight showed that our [Mental Health Toolkit](http://chayn.co/mental-health/)had over 500 views last year, after having only launched in June and hardly marketed, meaning that more and more NGOs and professionals are actively seeking information on[mental health](http://chayn.co/mental-health/) to support their communities and clients. We want to focus on outreach for this project in 2016 as it got neglected towards the end of last year!

 

Our [How To Build Your Own Domestic Violence Case Without A Lawyer guide](http://chayn.co/how-to-build-your-own-case/) had a whopping 7,856 views last year, after its official launch in November. This does not include all the offline use by NGOs and lawyers that are printing and distributing the guide. The guide is a much needed resource for survivors of domestic violence who cannot afford legal counsel, so this reassuring number shows that this guide and similar toolkits are the kinds of tools survivors need and actively seek out online. [Chayn ](http://chayn.co/)made waves in the media in 2015 as several of our projects featured in [print and multimedia, and in several different languages](http://chayn.co/about/press/)!

 

All of our toolkits, guides, websites, content, and events (hackathons, etc) are created with a global, diverse, and intersectional audience in mind. We translate all our guides and several blogs and articles into different languages and enthusiastically engage with the global community. This approach paid off in 2015 as [Chayn ](http://chayn.co/)garnered worldwide media attention for our achievements.

 

[Chayn](http://chayn.co/)’s universal approach combined with the world’s current fascination with all things tech led to coverage  of our [How To Build Your Own Domestic Violence Case Without A Lawyer Guide](http://chayn.co/how-to-build-your-own-case/) in GOOD Magazine titled [How One Website Is Changing the Way Women Fight Domestic Violence](https://magazine.good.is/articles/uk-project-empowers-any-woman-with-wi-fi-to-build-her-own-domestic-violence-case).

We believe in staying up-to-date and involved in current affairs and discourses centered around women’s rights, violence against women, activism, and feminism. [Chayn](http://chayn.co/)’s volunteers are encouraged to blog about topical news events and post opinion-led pieces as well as informative articles on the [Chayn blog](http://chayn.co/blog/), [Medium](https://medium.com/@chayn) ([India](https://medium.com/chayn-india/) & [Pakistan](https://medium.com/chayn-pakistan)), other websites and blogs, and on their personal websites. We also participated in ever popular social media discussions and events on Twitter and Facebook, connecting and sparking dialogue with similar organisations.
